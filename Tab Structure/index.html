      <h3>Seminar</h3>
      <p>
        A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at an academic
        institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It
        has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring
        meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which
        everyone present is requested to participate. This is often accomplished
        through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or
        instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is
        essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can
        be raised and debates can be conducted. At North American universities,
        the term "seminar" refers to a course of intense study relating to the
        student's major. Seminars typically have significantly fewer students
        per professor than normal courses, and are generally more specific in
        topic of study. Seminars can revolve around term papers, exams,
        presentations, and several other assignments. Seminars are almost always
        required for university graduation. Normally, participants must not be
        beginners in the field under discussion at US and Canadian universities.
        Seminar classes are generally reserved for upper-class students,
        although at UK and Australian universities seminars are often used for
        all years.

      <h3>Team Building</h3>
      <p>
        Team building is a collective term for various types of activities used
        to enhance social relations and define roles within teams, often
        involving collaborative tasks. It is distinct from team training, which
        is designed by a combine of business managers, learning and
        development/OD and an HR Business Partner to improve the efficiency,
        rather than interpersonal relations.Team building is one of the most
        widely used group-development activities in organizations.Of all
        organizational activities, one study found team-development to have the
        strongest effect for improving organizational performance. A 2008
        meta-analysis found that team-development activities, including team
        building and team training, improve both a team's objective performance
        and that team's subjective supervisory ratings.Many team-building
        exercises aim to expose and address interpersonal problems within the
        group.Over time, these activities are intended to improve performance in
        a team-based environment. Team building is one of the foundations of
        organizational development that can be applied to groups such as sports
        teams, school classes, military units or flight crews.
